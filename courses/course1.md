### **Beginner (Understanding the Basics)**

1. What Are Coroutines?
    - Definition and comparison to threads.
    - Why use coroutines? (lightweight, non-blocking).
2. Setting Up Coroutines in Kotlin
    - Adding dependencies (kotlinx.coroutines).
    - Brief mention of WebFlux
3. Launching Coroutines
    - launch vs async.
    - Launching coroutines with Futures
    - Other coroutine builders
4. Structured Concurrency
    - Parent-child relationship and CoroutineScope.
5. Coroutine Builders
    - Overview of launch, async, and runBlocking.
6. Delaying Execution
    - Using delay() and its non-blocking nature.
7. Jobs and Cancellation
    - Cancelling coroutines with cancel().

### **Intermediate (Working with Coroutines)**

1. Coroutine Context and Dispatchers
    - Dispatchers.Main, Dispatchers.IO, Dispatchers.Default, Dispatchers.Unconfined and newSingleThreadContext.
2. Exception Handling in Coroutines
    - try-catch and CoroutineExceptionHandler.
3. Scopes
    - GlobalScope, CoroutineScope, and lifecycle-aware scopes like viewModelScope in Android.
4. Asynchronous Flow
    - Introduction to Flow for handling streams of data.
5. Channels
    - Basics of Channel for communication between coroutines.
6. Select Expression
    - Waiting on multiple suspending functions.

### **Advanced (Optimizing and Scaling Coroutines)**

1. Coroutine Builders in Depth
    - Difference between launch and async return types (Job vs Deferred).
2. Shared Mutable State and Concurrency
    - Managing state with Mutex and Atomic types.
3. Custom Coroutine Context
    - Creating your own CoroutineDispatcher.
4. Deep Dive into Flows
    - Operators (map, filter, collect, flatMapLatest) and backpressure handling.
5. Testing Coroutines
    - Using TestCoroutineScope and TestCoroutineDispatcher.
6. Integration with Frameworks
    - Coroutines in Spring (@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, suspend functions).
7. Virtual Threads and Coroutines
    - Comparing Kotlin coroutines with Java virtual threads (Loom).
8. Optimizing Performance
    - Profiling and tuning coroutine usage.
9. Coroutine Debugging Tools
    - Tools like IntelliJâ€™s coroutine debugger.
10. Advanced Exception Aggregation
    - Supervisor jobs and propagating exceptions.
11. Custom Suspend Functions
    - Writing reusable suspendable functions.

### **Expert (Exploring the Edges)**

1. Coroutine Integration with Reactive Frameworks
    - Combining coroutines with Reactor or RxJava.
2. Deep Dive into Coroutine Cancellation
    - Ensuring cleanup using finally and ensureActive().
3. Coroutine-based DSLs
    - Writing DSLs with coroutines (e.g., building a test framework).
4. Cold vs Hot Flows
    - Behavior, lifecycle, and advanced flow optimizations.
5. Working with StateFlow and SharedFlow
    - Advanced state-sharing techniques.
6. Multi-threaded Coroutines
    - Understanding thread confinement and context switching.
7. Coroutines and CRaC
    - Experimental coroutine behavior with Checkpoint/Restore (if applicable).
8. Cross-language Comparisons
    - Kotlin coroutines vs Go goroutines vs Java Loom.
