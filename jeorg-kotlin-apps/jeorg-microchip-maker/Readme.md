# JEsperancinha.Org Microchip Maker

In this exercise we will see how can we use Kto as a backend application to serve a front end that will draw the position of the chips.
It will then:

1. Check if all the chip slabs are correctly set in the wafer
2. Mark all chips not 100% contained in the wafer in red
3. Mark all the chips 100% contained in wafer in green
4. Select only the chips that are valid and for our exercise, those are all chips with measurements higher than 95%.

This exercise is inspired by lots of exercises I did years ago with an EPROM. Any similarity with anything you've seen before is purely coincidence.
